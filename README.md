**[Kona Currents, LLC](https://konacurrents.com)**
offers downloadable software and apps for creation, collection, processing, and management of optical visual markers. We call these a Semantic Marker&trade; This incluces An innovative text and optical search engine, along with an API for processing optical labels, barcodes and two-dimensional codes. These optical image and data files are downloadable for internal and external use. Apps also interact through published API's with our Cloud Computing services. 

Both public and private aspects of this GitHub include downloadable software for running the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including the new ESP-32 family of embedded processors. 
The areas of processing include app software for ESP-32 and mobile devices (i.e. iPhone, watch, TV, etc). This also includes code for the cloud service processes. These are a mix of 
web servers (i.e, Apache Tomcat, and Nodered), also powerful messaging capabilities (including MQTT, Websockets, HTTP, DDS, etc).

<b>Kona Currents, LLC</b> introduces a new approach for interacting with our technologically rich environment
 - such as Smart Devices and Internet of Things (IoT). Special optical visual markers, we call a <b>Semantic
Marker&trade;</b> such as two-dimensional code images and barcodes, <i>come alive</i> through interactive fee
dback with the environment; continual scanning will send secure internet messages to IoT devices (like to the
 IoT dog feeder in video) and even show unique interactive <i>Augmented Reality</i> graphic overlays based on
 contextually and semantically relevent information (can you say <i>Minority Report</i>!).
