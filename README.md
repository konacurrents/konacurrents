**[Kona Currents, LLC](https://konacurrents.com)**
offers downloadable software and apps for creation, collection, processing, and management of optical visual markers. We call these a Semantic Marker&reg; This incluces An innovative text and optical search engine, along with an API for processing optical labels, barcodes and two-dimensional codes. These optical image and data files are downloadable for internal and external use. Apps also interact through published API's with our Cloud Computing services (various public download links below.)

Both public and private aspects of this GitHub include downloadable software for running the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including the new ESP-32 family of embedded processors. 
The areas of processing include app software for ESP-32 and mobile devices (i.e. iPhone, watch, TV, etc). This also includes code for the cloud service processes. These are a mix of 
web servers (i.e, Apache Tomcat, and Nodered), also powerful messaging capabilities (including MQTT, Websockets, HTTP, DDS, [telegram](https://telegram.org), etc.)

# SemanticMarker&reg; Optical Visual Marker Processing
<img src="https://SemanticMarker.org/vision/SemanticMarkerQR.png" width="300">
<b>Kona Currents, LLC</b> introduces a new approach for interacting with our technologically rich environment
 - such as Smart Devices and Internet of Things (IoT). Special optical visual markers, we call a <b>Semantic
Marker&reg;</b> such as two-dimensional code images and barcodes, <i>come alive</i> through interactive fee
dback with the environment; continual scanning will send secure internet messages to IoT devices (like to the
 IoT dog feeder in video) and even show unique interactive <i>Augmented Reality</i> graphic overlays based on
 contextually and semantically relevent information (can you say <i>Minority Report</i>!).

 ![Optical Visual Marker](https://SemanticMarker.org/images/SemanticMarkerSemantics.jpeg)

 We humans (mostly) use our `Visual` skills to make sense of our environment. 
 But we also use `Optical` tools to enhance (or even make sense) of the same visual environemnt. For example,
 an optical telescope brings things closer for better understanding (like Planets or climbers on a wall._ 
 Vision recognition of faces or text is also useful. The
 advantage of a visual two-dimensional code is that special optics can now translate the
 image into perfect information. So our vision is extended with optics
 resulting in an Optical Visual Marker - or our `Trademarked` name: Semantic Marker&reg;

## Various Semantic Marker&reg; Aware Apps 
### Example Semantic Marker&reg; iOS App image
<img src="https://SemanticMarker.org/vision/SemanticMarkerApp1.jpeg" width="300">
This app provides a multitude of capabilities centered around the Semantic Marker&reg; capabilities. This includes
scanning a Semantic Marker&reg; and sending a message to the named dog feeding device over bluetooth.

### Example Semantic Marker &reg; appleWatch App image
<img src="https://SemanticMarker.org/vision/WatchSM.jpg" width="300">
Here the Semantic Marker&reg; is sent to the watch through messages. Clicking expands to show the Avatar image while hiding
the machine readable portion of the Semantic Marker&reg;. Here our unique SMART Button framework is creating the
Avatar image from information gathered in the secure messaging network.

### ESP-32 App supporting the Semantic Marker&reg; capabilities

The following shows the (small) ESP-32 M5 Device using software developed by Kona Currents, LLC, to support
the Semantic Marker&reg; optical visual marker infrastructure. This is actually a continually changing Semantic Marker&reg; image
reflecting the changing sensor values. The <i>Augmented Reality</i> overlay from the iOS App would show those changing values,
otherwise a static web page would just show a snapshot. The Semantic Marker&reg; optical visual marker is unique in the amount of information
that can be encoded in an <b>image</b>, contrasted with trying to display similar information in this small display (think of the movie <i>Matrix</i> and the moving green images.)
